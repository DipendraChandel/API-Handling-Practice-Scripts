# API Handling Practice with Python  

This repository contains my **Python practice scripts for API handling and data integration**.  
The goal is to build hands-on experience in working with external APIs, extracting JSON data, and storing it in databases like **SQLite3**.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Fetch data from public APIs using the `requests` library  
- Parse and handle nested JSON structures  
- Gracefully manage missing values and errors  
- Store structured data into **SQLite3 databases**  
- Beginner-friendly, extendable scripts for learning and practice
